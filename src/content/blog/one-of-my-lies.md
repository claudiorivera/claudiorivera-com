Inspired by all the fun videos that musicians are putting out (particularly [the Goldfinger ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0rSYEoBMYM), since they're a band that's near and dear to me), I decided to challenge myself to do a similar quasi-live video. Here it is:

<div class="embed"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gX_lQrWY0kE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Since I'm not the greatest guitar player, I decided to stick to something that I could handle (or at least pass off as "good enough for punk music"). ðŸ˜Ž

I went with "One Of My Lies", off the Green Day album "[Kerplunk](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerplunk_(album)>)", which has always been one of my favorite songs, even though I didn't know all the lyrics until last week.

In the spirit of capturing a quasi-live band performance, I did these in full takes, without editing. I did about three drum takes before I was happy, maybe a dozen bass takes, and roughly a billion guitar/vocal takes. Haha. I kept fucking up the lyrics (I still did flub a couple tiny things, in the end), but mostly I was just messing up the guitar-playing, which is an impressive feat when you consider that Green Day is not exactly a band covered extensively by Guitar Player magazine.

Anyway, this was a blast to make, and I'm excited to try another one soon! Maybe something even easier on guitar? ðŸ˜‚
