Hi, friends! Please welcome “[Habit & Routine: Vol. 2](https://artist.landr.com/music/628810988617)” into the world!

Only half the songs as last time, but twice as many guitar solos, I think. The fact that the number of solos is increasing disproportionally to the quality of the guitar playing just shows that maybe I’m becoming a real guitar player? (That was a sick burn on guitar players, but also self-deprecating, which makes it ironic and humorous, just like people on Internet!)

Anyway, like last time, I wrote, performed, recorded, and mixed everything in my practice space, over the last few months. I’m stoked with how they turned out and look forward to putting out more stuff this year.

And if you didn’t get a chance to listen to the first batch, those are still streaming, as well!

Thanks!
