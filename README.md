This is the source code to my web site, [claudiorivera.com](https://claudiorivera.com).

I migrated from a Wordpress site hosted on Linode to this Gatsby site on Vercel, and I'm pretty happy with the results.

The design is my best attempt at duplicating the excellent [Twenty Twenty](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/) theme that my previous site ran on, but with a few minor tweaks.

The main content (blog posts, development portfolio items, and musical experience) is now Markdown, instead of using the Wordpress CMS.

# Future Improvements

- Optimize GraphQL queries
- Find a way to use Material-UI without so many style overrides (by way of theming correctly)
- Look into using MDX or perhaps another way of incorporating Material-UI components in the Markdown content, so there won't be as many global overrides.
- Style the music page better (this is a carry-over from my original Wordpress site)
- Blog category pages
- Blog pagination
