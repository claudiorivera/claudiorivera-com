In a few days, I start my first job as a Software Developer. A few people asked me about how I taught myself, so I decided to put together some resources for anyone who was interested in doing what I did.

A huge disclaimer: I've been obsessed with technology ever since elementary school, where teachers plopped me down in front of an [Apple IIe](https://apple2history.org/history/ah07/) and showed me how I could make my own [Mad Libs](https://www.madlibs.com) and where I learned the amusing novelty of [`20 GOTO 10` in BASIC](https://betanews.com/2014/05/01/10-print-hello-50-years-of-basic-20-goto-10/). The joy of seeing a computer do exactly what I programmed it to do carried with me all the way through high school and beyond.

I recall making web sites for [one of my old bands](https://web.archive.org/web/19991012050242/http://flipsyde.com/). Around that time, I was also getting really into Photoshop--designing the majority of said band's [first album art](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.319108414874630.76859.295314023920736&type=3). In high school, I learned a ton of stuff from their [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking). There was also a summer internship at [a local technology company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/winterlogic-inc-/about/): I learned about [AND gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate), made them a Flash animation for their web site, complained about having to use Linux instead of Windows (ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and left to pursue music. Some years later, I remember making a simple app (click on [my friend Diaz](https://www.briandiazphoto.com)'s face and hear him scream) on the very [first Android phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream).

So, this is definitely not an "I went from zero coding experience to developer in just six months!" type story, but I do believe that anyone who wants to do this can, regardless of experience level! I think the key is having a genuine interest in doing this and not just seeing it as a [lucrative career opportunity](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/junior-software-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,25.htm).

Have a look at this video by [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com) that talks a little bit about this:

If you're still excited about learning, let's dig in!

### My Learning Regimen

The curriculum I followed was loosely based on what my spouse was learning through [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io/courses/engineering), which is fairly typical of a coding bootcamp. I would ask her what she's learning that day, and I'd go and learn it myself. When she got an assignment and starter code, I would look at the code to get the general idea, and then start from scratch, [reading the docs](https://devdocs.io) along the way.

The main topics are the following:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) and/or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

When I felt like I had a good grasp on something, I would find a different resource that covered the same topic, and I would go through that course/video/article as well. For every new topic, I would probably do a total of 2-3 full course tutorials on any given topic.

One thing you pick up on is that there is more than one way to skin a cat. If there doesn't seem to be one clear way of doing things, I defer to that technology's documentation. Every framework or library has a "Getting Started" guide, and that's obviously the best place to start.

#### Lynda.com

Probably my most-used resource was a free subscription to LinkedIn's [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com), courtesy of my public library. I highly recommend checking with your library, as this is normally a service that costs around \$30/month!

I watched dozens of courses, but these are the ones I learned the most from and that I would recommend completing in their entirety:

- [JavaScript Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Essential-Training/574716-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3ajavascript+essentials%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) by [Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://mor10.com)
- [React.js Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/React-js-Essential-Training-REVISION-Q4-2020/2849005-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3areact.js+essential%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) by [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello)
- [Express Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Express-Essential-Training/679637-2.html) by Emmanuel Henri
- [Advanced Express](https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Advanced-Express/798496-2.html) by [Daniel Khan](https://twitter.com/dkhan)

#### YouTube

As I'm sure you're aware, you can teach yourself anything on YouTube! Here are some courses that really helped me:

- [React JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A) by [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb)
- [Learn the MERN Stack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE) by [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb)
- [What the Flexbox?!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7xj_y6NIAhy0wuCd4uVdid) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com)

#### freeCodeCamp

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is one of the best resources online for learning to code. I would highly recommend it for people who are starting with absolutely zero prior experience, as the pacing is slow and covers everything, beginning with the absolute basics. I completed the entire Responsive Web Design section over the course of a few months, again, in tandem with everything else here.

#### The Odin Project

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) was a resource that I didn't discover until later, and if I could go back, I probably would follow their Foundations and Full Stack curriculums in their entirety, as they use a variety of different resources and the curriculum stays updated by the community.

#### Things I Tried To Do Daily

- One kata from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)
- One day/chapter from [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com)
- One random video from YouTube before bed (or, sometimes, while falling asleep in bed üòÇ)
